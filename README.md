Note: Change to all lowercase when you clone so npm/npx doesn't complain.

|Version | Notes |
|---|---|
| v0.1.0 | Bare minimum |
| v0.1.1 | Undo, insert/remove, edit header, scrollbars, save-as |

## Prompt

For tomorrow's demo, please have Keenan use the attached CSV file of basic user information. I would like to see a simple table displaying this information, and a basic editor that allows for editing the fields and/or deleting one of the users. That seems like it would be a good test of spinning up on React given the short timeframe involved.

## Description

This repo implements the bare minimum of what was requested (see above), but also provides guards for overwriting files unintentionally and prevents the user from deleting the header.
